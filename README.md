# Data Science Mini Portfolio — README

This repository contains a collection of beginner-friendly data science mini projects created using Python. The goal of this portfolio is to demonstrate foundational skills in data analysis, web scraping, and data preprocessing.

##  Project Overview

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

   * Creates a sample dataset of students
   * Computes total and average marks
   * Classifies high performers using NumPy conditions

2. Web Scraping using Requests + BeautifulSoup

   * Scrapes quotes and author names from a demo website
   * Stores results into a Pandas DataFrame

3. CSV Cleaning & Preprocessing

   * Simulates a raw CSV with missing values
   * Handles missing data using mean imputation
   * Exports cleaned version for further analysis

Technologies Used

* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Requests
* BeautifulSoup

Files Included

* `students.csv` — Raw sample dataset
* `students_cleaned.csv` — Cleaned dataset output

Learning Outcomes

* Basic EDA and DataFrame manipulation
* Web scraping fundamentals
* Data cleaning and preprocessing workflow
